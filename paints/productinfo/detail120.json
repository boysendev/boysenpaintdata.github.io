It envelopes the night with mysterious aura, silently luring a curious spectator in. Its lulling presence pacifies the hardness of the day. Utterly hypnotizing, one experiences a sense of calm and completeness. Dazed eyes can't simply look away from it. Further zoom into its surface, it boasts varying textures - tiny and large craters, dark stretches, and rough impacts. Bombarded with asteroids and meteorites colliding with the lunar surface, it comes out beautifully undone. The moon is perfectly imperfect. \n\nThe Konstrukt&trade; Lunar Series is inspired by the aesthetically fascinating features of the moon. Each faux finish is striking but not overwhelming to the eye. The minimalist appeal and sleek ambiance add a flair of sophistication to any living space. Its simplicity and versatility render it as a perfect backdrop to highlight centerpieces. It is subtle but impactful - luxurious without being indulgent."},{"title":"SURFACE PREPARATION","variant":"1","subtitle":"","body":"Remove honeycomb and loose concrete.\nCheck and repair all relevant surface defects (i.e., cracks, gaps) by corrective civil works, water proof as necessary.\nMake sure that the surface to be coated is clean, dry and that good weather persists prior to application."},{"title":"MIXING AND APPLICATION PROCEDURE","variant":"1","subtitle":"","body":"1.
